            <h2>Who is Tyler?</h2>
            <p>I'm Tyler, I am an outdoor enthusiast and an asprining web developer. My goal in life is to simply reside in the mounatins, so that I can snowboard, hike, backpack, mountain bike, etc. The vehicle to get me there is defintely in the tech world! It's basically recession proof and for the most part can be done remtely.</p>

            <h2>Where do I want to live?</h2>
            <p>My dream is to return to Colorado and settle into a mountain town, near as many ski resorts as possible. My ideal city would be Silverthorne, CO, because it's between Breckenridge, Steamboat Springs, Keystone, A-basin, Winter Park and many more! It's the perfect place for me. I miss teh crisp mounatin air that fills my lungs and the smile I can seemingly never rid my face of!</p>
